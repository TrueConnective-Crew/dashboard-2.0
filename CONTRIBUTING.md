## Git Workflow

1. Create a branch for your work
2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages
3. Keep your branch updated with the main repository
4. Squash commits before merging if necessary
5. Use GitMoji in commit messages to categorize changes (see below)

### GitMoji

We use GitMoji to add visual cues to our commit messages. This helps to quickly identify the purpose of a commit. Please prefix your commit messages with the appropriate emoji:

[Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)

Example: `üêõ fix: resolve issue with authentication timeout`

## Versioning

1. MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
3. PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

When contributing, be mindful of how your changes might affect the version number:

- Bug fixes will increment the PATCH version
- New features that don't break existing functionality will increment the MINOR version
- Breaking changes will increment the MAJOR version

## Changelog
